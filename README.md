Project Title : Fake Product Review System. Run the [1] to import all the necessary libraries, classifiers to run the project. Run the [3] to get overview of dataset. Run [4] to split data to test and train. Run [5] to preprocess it. Run [6] of Knn classifier with k=5 then to get the evaluation metrics  and confusion matrix of knn, run [8]. Run [9] for Random forest classifier then to get the evaluation metrics  and confusion matrix of Random Forest Classifier, run [11]. Run [12] for SVM then to get the evaluation metrics  and confusion matrix of SVM, run [15]. Run [16] for Decision Tree classifier then to get the evaluation metrics  and confusion matrix of DecisionTree Classifier run [18].
